public methods to be tested:
    public AccountStore()
    // TBD:
    // public AccountStore(char[] password)
    public AccountStore(InputStream rawInput, char[] password)
    public void addAccount(Account newAccount)
    public void updateAccount(Account account,
			      String description, String url,
			      String username, String password)
    public Account createAccount(String description, String url,
				 String username, String password)
    public void deleteAccount(Account account)
    public int size()
    public Iterable<Account> allAccounts()
    public void readAccounts(InputStream raw, char[] password)
    public void writeAccounts(OutputStream raw, char[] password)
    public void writeAccounts(OutputStream raw)

Given:  Each of the following, in turn
    AccountStore constructed by calling addAccount() with program data
	varying order in adding entries
	varying number of entries
	N.B. this given tests addAccount()
    AccountStore read from V0 file
    AccountStore read from V1 file
    AccountStore read from V2 file
Assertions: (some redunancy here)
    size matches number of entries as constructed
    size matches number of entries entries seen during iteration
    entries seen during iteration match contents as constructed
	entries are seen in canonical order
	"matches" defined by version as constructed
	no duplicates
	nothing added
	nothing removed

Action:
    write AccountStore to temp file, read it back
	with new password
	using implicit password
Assertions:
    original and result from file are equal via equals()

Action:
    Update one (more?) Account entries in the AccountStore
Assertions:
    size is unchanged
    updated account entries reflect the update
    other entries are unchanged
