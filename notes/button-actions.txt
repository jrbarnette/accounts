paths by which AccountStorePanel.autosaveAccountStore() can be invoked

click on "Delete" button ->
    deleteAccount()
click on updateButton (either text state) ->
    updateAccountStore()

at start-up, need to disable
    account data text fields
    "Generate" button
... only options available should be "File->New" and "File->Open"

File menu & account store panel are in one of these states (same state must
apply to both of them):
  * open - after "File->New" or "File->Open"
	AccountStoreUI: all file operations allowed
	AccountStorePanel: all operations enabled
  * startup - at startup when no file is provided
	AccountStoreUI: enable "File->New" "File->Open"
	AccountStoreUI: disable "File->Save As" "File->Merge"
	AccountStorePanel: all disabled
  * error - after autosave exception
	AccountStoreUI: enable "File->New" "File->Open" "File->Save As"
	    (optional: require user confirm for New or Open)
	AccountStoreUI: disable "File->Merge"
	AccountStorePanel: disable all except EARLIER/LATER (and COPY?)
