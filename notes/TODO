Bugs/risks:
  * The Save As dialog should ask for the password twice, to
    guarantee that it's not mis-typed.
  * The various file dialogs shouldn't enable the action button
    until there's a valid password.
  * When opening a V0 file, the password is remembered, but in
    AccountData, fileKey is initialized differently.  It's not
    clear to me whether this is correct.
  * Maybe we should drop support for V0 files, rather than ask
    whether the handling is correct...

Start solving the history/merge problem:
  * Merge two different files with overlapping data
  * Be able to recover older passwords.

Don't silently discard field changes when selecting a new account.

Save password generation parameters with the account.

Change Icon/naming so that the running program can be distinguished
from other Java programs.

Keyboard shortcuts

Organize the accounts list hierarchically (or some other layout?)

Save file as executable script that embeds the account data shar-style

Button to open URL

change focus-cycle so that from password, we go to "Update" or "Change"
    or maybe:  if changes, "Update/Change", if no changes "Copy"
