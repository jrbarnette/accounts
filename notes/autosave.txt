Design issue:
  - For autosave to work, there should be a backing file at all
    times.  At startup, we don't have a file (unless it was given on
    the command line), so we have to get one.
  - There are two ways to get the file:
      - "File->New", to create a new file.
      - "File->Open", to open an existing file.
    The UI for these two options isn't interchangeable; the user
    must somehow choose one or the other.

Options:
  - At startup, present the user with a small dialog to choose
    between a new or existing file.
  - Until the backing file is chosen, block all operations except the
    "File->New" or "File->Open" menu options.
  - Ignore the problem?  In current code, until the backing file is
    chosen, it uses an anonymous account store that exists in memory
    only.  This means "New" and "Open" will throw away the in-memory
    copy (so, maybe, block these operations?).
