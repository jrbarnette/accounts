Refactoring and missing test coverage that would be nice/necessary:
  * There's too much boilerplate in the TestAccountStore* classes;
    can we do better?
      + Yes, if we bundle all versions into a single class.
      + Rationale for separate classes is "it's easier to delete a
	file format if it's one per class."  Does that matter?
      + Experiment:  What if @Test is applied to a method in an
	abstract class?
  * Want testing for AccountStore.writeAccounts() both with and
    without the password supplied as a parameter.
  * Want testing for AccountStore.readAccounts() separate from the
    testing that happens via the constructor (see the bug cited in
    notes/TODO).
  * Want testing for AccountStore.updateAcount() and
    AccountStore.createAcount().
